Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's a sample letter application for fever:

Subject: Leave Application Due to Fever

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work today due to a fever. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and my temperature is currently above 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

I have already contacted my doctor and he has advised me to rest and recover at home. I will be taking medication and following his recommended treatment plan to ensure a speedy recovery.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work once I am feeling better. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to work.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

Akash
