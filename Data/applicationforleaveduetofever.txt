Subject: Application for Leave Due to Fever

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to attend work for the next few days due to a sudden onset of fever. I woke up this morning feeling unwell, with a high temperature and body aches. I have consulted with a doctor, who has advised me to rest and recover at home.

I regret any inconvenience this may cause, and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to work.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,

Akash
